# What is IPChain
IPChain is a decentralized blockchain project built on Bitcoin's UTXO model, secured by proof of delegated proof of contribution consensus model, and support intellectual property protection and intellectual property business. It achieves this through the revolutionary extended transation model, effective consensus mechanize and so on. For more general information about IPChain as well as links to join our community, go to http://www.ipcchain.org

Welcome to the IPChain Main Network. This is the main network where the tokens hold value and should be guarded very carefully. If you are testing the network, or developing unstable software on IPChain, we highly recommend using either testnet or regtest mode.

The major features of the IPChain network include:

1. Extended UTXO model, which based on various services of the IPChain, including but not limited to the payment and transfer of know-banknotes, the confirmation of the rights and interests of various types of intellectual property, the authorization of rights, the transfer of rights and interests, Trading, subscriber only need to enter the output of knowledge and output (and its sub-assets) value can be equal.

2. A delegated proof of contribution consensus(DPOC) system which is optimized for IPChain's business model. Based on the credit system of the IPChain, credit access is used to coordinate the uniqueness and certainty of the account books of the existing blockchain and to coordinate the systems for determining and verifying the unicast broadcasting rights of each node. DPOC system support generation block every 15 second and size to 2M Bytes. 

3. Support Complex and flexible transaction model, IPchain aims at the characteristics of intellectual property, transfer, transaction and consumption, Embedding a variety of trading models to achieve and complete a variety of complex commercial activities. Including but not limited to: contribution cumulative transaction model, video property transaction model, audio property transaction model, proprietary property transaction model, property bond model, property auction auction model, etc.

4. The Decentralized Governance Protocol is completely implemented and functional, which allows certain network parameters to be modified without a fork or other network disruption. This currently controls parameters like block size,  etc.

Note: IPChain Core is considered beta software. We make no warranties or guarantees of its security or stability.
